1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Definition
Managing the day-to-day activities of a hospital—such as patient registration, doctor appointments, staff management, billing, and record-keeping—can be complex and time-consuming when done manually. Errors, delays, and data loss are common in traditional systems. This calls for a well-organized and reliable system that simplifies and automates the hospital's core functions.

1.2 Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to develop a Hospital Management System (HMS) that helps streamline hospital operations, improve patient care, and make administrative tasks more efficient. It aims to reduce paperwork, minimize errors, and enable quick access to important information for both patients and hospital staff.

1.3 Scope
This system will handle functions such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor allocation, inpatient and outpatient records, billing, and report generation. It is designed for use in small to mid-sized hospitals or clinics, and can later be scaled or customized for larger facilities.

1.4 User and Literature Survey
During the initial phase of the project, feedback and suggestions were gathered from medical staff, administrative personnel, and IT professionals working in hospitals. Research was also conducted on existing hospital management systems to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This helped shape the design and functionality of our system to better suit real-world needs.
